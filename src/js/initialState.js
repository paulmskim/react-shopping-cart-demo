They will help you maintain a firm grip on the disc whether you\'re catching or throwing. They eliminate slippage when the disc is wet, keep your hands warm in cold weather, and ease the sting of zippy throws. Whether your goal is to throw with more accuracy, catch tough discs, or just look fly, Frictions will help.  Frictions are not bulky or stiff like other gloves. They are tight fitting and, after a while, you\'ll forget they\'re even on!',
